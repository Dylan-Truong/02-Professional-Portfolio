# 02-Professional-Portfolio

For this challenge, I created a portfolio to showcase my skills and knowledge I've learned during the bootcamp. This will be useful for future employers in any software engineeering companies that can display my personal work and job searching in the future. 

* Used sample portfolio, but customized with the colors and styles of my choice.
* Created Sections of About Me, My Work, and Socials.
* Added navigation links that is functional.
* Included a photo of myself on header and icon.
* Added links to projects I've done during UTA Coding Bootcamp.
* Dimensions on multiple screens for phones and tablets works functionally.
* Included hover effects on navigation links, projects, and socials.
